This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
add .env file with your OPENAI_API_KEY=LISTED_IN_THERE

install dependencies 

```bash
npm install

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Upload a pic, then hit 'Describe' button.
Then once the text is done generating, click 'Generate Audio' button.
Then click the audio play control to play the Audio.

Note: a recently added feature makes how the description is made (a Bostonian who loves Lobster Rolls) dynamic, so you can change that via a textarea if you want.
